# Payment Instructions

International payments are tricky: different countries use different payment systems, require different parameters, and have lots of weird rules.

We've made a simple instruction on how to transfer money with TransferWise, hopefully, it will save you some time.

If you would like to make a **single payment**, you can follow this instruction: [Single Transferwise Payment Instruction](single_payment.md).

You can also **save our bank credentials** by saving our bank details as a _recipient_ for future use, to save time later. With this, instead of filling our details for every transfer, you can just select an existing `mova.io` recipient, fill the amount you would like to transfer, and it will use previously saved bank credentials: [Creating a TransferWise Recipient](add_recipient.md)
