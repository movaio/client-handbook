# Client Handbook

This repository is a simple list of small guides that will help during project development. Here we try to describe how to sign up for your own Amazon AWS account, how to set up Google Merchant accounts for IAP, and so on.

Most of those things have to be done by a project owner, so we just decided to make an instruction, to make customer's life easier.
